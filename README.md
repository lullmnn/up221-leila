I am working on a Master's thesis that looks at how tech companies like Google mine neighborhood level data through the remote sensing capabilities of autonomous vehicles, like Waymo, and hgow that transforms collective neighborhood memory in the long term. I am looking at a few datasets that have been published by Waymo and hope to learn how to visually and spatially represent where Waymo's are driving through, how they percieve these neighborhoods, and combine that with other data that indicates neighborhood change. 

I am very new to python (though have tried other coding languages) and am nervous but excited to learn this new language and see what I can do with it.
